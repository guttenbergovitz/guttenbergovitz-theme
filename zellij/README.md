# Guttenbergovitz for Zellij

> "It's not the notes you play, it's the notes you don't play." - Miles Davis

A warm, vintage-inspired theme for [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/), matching the Guttenbergovitz color scheme.

## About

Guttenbergovitz was conceived during a deep dive into jazz history, evolving from a discussion about the parallels between music evolution and code aesthetics. Just as Miles Davis stripped jazz to its essence in "Kind of Blue", this theme aims to reduce visual noise while maintaining depth and character.

## Philosophy

Drawing inspiration from both old European printing traditions and modern color science, Guttenbergovitz combines the warmth of vintage manuscripts with contemporary minimalist design principles. It's like a well-aged whiskey - complex but not overwhelming.

## Design Principles

- Less blue light, more warmth
- Minimal but meaningful syntax highlighting
- Focus on readability and reduced eye strain
- Inspired by vintage book printing
- Professional without being corporate
- Like Count Basie's orchestra: elegant, precise, and purposeful
