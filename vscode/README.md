# Guttenbergovitz Theme

> "It's not the notes you play, it's the notes you don't play." - Miles Davis

## About

Guttenbergovitz was conceived during a deep dive into jazz history, evolving from a discussion about the parallels between music evolution and code aesthetics. Just as Miles Davis stripped jazz to its essence in "Kind of Blue", this theme aims to reduce visual noise while maintaining depth and character.

## Philosophy

Drawing inspiration from both old European printing traditions and modern color science, Guttenbergovitz combines the warmth of vintage manuscripts with contemporary minimalist design principles. It's like a well-aged whiskey - complex but not overwhelming.

## Credits & Inspiration

This theme stands on the shoulders of giants:
- Nord's minimalist philosophy
- Gruvbox's warm palette foundations
- Poimandres' approach to syntax highlighting
- EverForest's natural aesthetics

Each of these themes contributed to our understanding of what makes a great coding environment, much like how blues laid the foundation for jazz evolution.

## Design Principles

- Less blue light, more warmth
- Minimal but meaningful syntax highlighting
- Focus on readability and reduced eye strain
- Inspired by vintage book printing
- Professional without being corporate
- Like Count Basie's orchestra: elegant, precise, and purposeful

## Status

This is a Work in Progress (WIP). Like jazz itself, we believe in constant evolution and improvement.

## The Name

"Guttenbergovitz" merges Gutenberg's printing heritage with Eastern European craftsmanship tradition (-ovitz), reflecting our commitment to both historical respect and modern utility.

## Design Notes

- Warm-first: orange/brown accents reduce blue light without losing contrast.
- ANSI remap: terminals and terminal panels use warm equivalents (blue→`#d79969`, magenta→`#a96b69`, cyan→`#89a87d`).
- Comments: italics are preferred for hierarchy; adjust via editor settings if needed.
